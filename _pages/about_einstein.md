I am Professeur (PhD, HDR) in Artificial Intelligence and Medical Imaging at Télécom Paris in the IMAGES group of the LTCI lab. I am also a research collaborator of the research laboratory NeuroSpin at the CEA.

I did my academic training with Inria at the ARAMIS Lab in Paris where I worked with Stanley Durrleman (Inria Researcher), Olivier Colliot (CNRS Research Director) and Nicholas Ayache (Inria Research Director) and then at Neurospin (CEA) with Edouard Duchesnay (CEA Research Scientist), Josselin Houenou (M.D. APHP) and Jean-François Mangin (CEA Research Director). Previous to that, I obtained a MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Computation from the DTU in Copenhagen and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Padova.

I participated to the development of the open source software deformetrica for statistical shape analysis and of the software platform Clinica for clinical neuroimaging studies.

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of machine learning, AI, representation learning, medical imaging and computational anatomy.
