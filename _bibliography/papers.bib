	title = {Double {InfoGAN} for {Contrastive} {Analysis}},
	abstract = {Contrastive Analysis (CA) deals with the discovery of what is common and what is distinctive of a target domain compared to a background one. This is of great interest in many applications, such as medical imaging. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are latent variable models based on VAE (CAVAEs). However, they all either ignore important constraints or they don’t enforce fundamental assumptions. This may lead to suboptimal solutions where distinctive factors are mistaken for common ones (or viceversa). Furthermore, the generated images have a rather poor quality, typical of VAEs, decreasing their interpretability and usefulness. Here, we propose Double InfoGAN, the first GAN based method for CA that leverages the high-quality synthesis of GAN and the separation power of InfoGAN. Experimental results on four visual datasets, from simple synthetic examples to complex medical images, show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA CA-VAEs in terms of latent separation and image quality. Datasets and code are available online1.},

	abstract = {Traditional supervised learning with deep neural networks requires a tremendous amount of labelled data to converge to a good solution. For 3D medical images, it is often impractical to build a large homogeneous annotated dataset for a specific pathology. Self-supervised methods offer a new way to learn a representation of the images in an unsupervised manner with a neural network. In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by (almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks. Nonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such as participant’s age, viewed as prior knowledge. Here, we propose to leverage continuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by introducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve the positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with similar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar discriminative semantic features. With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on \$\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$\$104multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for three classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer’s detection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on these tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is made publicly available here.},

	abstract = {Contrastive Learning has shown impressive results on natural and medical images, without requiring annotated data. However, a particularity of medical images is the availability of meta-data (such as age or sex) that can be exploited for learning representations. Here, we show that the recently proposed contrastive y-Aware InfoNCE loss, that integrates multi-dimensional meta-data, asymptotically optimizes two properties: conditional alignment and global uniformity. Similarly to [Wang, 2020], conditional alignment means that similar samples should have similar features, but conditionally on the meta-data. Instead, global uniformity means that the (normalized) features should be uniformly distributed on the unit hyper-sphere, independently of the meta-data. Here, we propose to define conditional uniformity, relying on the meta-data, that repel only samples with dissimilar meta-data. We show that direct optimization of both conditional alignment and uniformity improves the representations, in terms of linear evaluation, on both CIFAR-100 and a brain MRI dataset.},

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques and tractography techniques provide a representation of the anatomical connections in the white matter, as hundreds of thousands of streamlines, forming the tractogram. The literature on methods for aligning tractograms is in active development and provides methods that operate either from voxel information, e.g. fractional anisotropy, orientation distribution function, T1-weighted MRI, or directly from streamline information. In this work, we align streamlines using the linear assignment problem (LAP) and propose a method to reduce the high computational cost of aligning whole brain tractograms. As further contribution, we present a comparison among some of the freely-available linear and nonlinear tractogram alignment methods, where we show that our LAP-based method outperforms all others. In discussing the results, we show that a main limitation of all streamline-based nonlinear registration methods is the computational cost and that addressing such problem may lead to further improvement in the quality of registration.},

Since color labels are rare and costly to acquire, our method leverages weakly supervised learning for conditional GANs. This enables to learn a controllable synthesis of complex objects, and only requires a weak proxy of the image attribute that we desire to modify.

From a mathematical point of view, this can be defined as a clustering task driven by supervised learning in order to uncover subgroups in line with the supervised prediction. In this paper, we propose a general Expectation-Maximization ensemble framework entitled UCSL (Unsupervised Clustering driven by Supervised Learning). Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and can be driven by both binary classification and regression. We propose to construct a non-linear model by merging multiple linear estimators, one per cluster. Each hyperplane is estimated so that it correctly discriminates - or predict - only one cluster. We use SVC or Logistic Regression for classification and SVR for regression. Furthermore, to perform cluster analysis within a more suitable space, we also propose a dimension-reduction algorithm that projects the data onto an orthonormal space relevant to the supervised task. We analyze the robustness and generalization capability of our algorithm using synthetic and experimental datasets. In particular, we validate its ability to identify suitable consistent sub-types by conducting a psychiatric-diseases cluster analysis with known ground-truth labels. The gain of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art techniques is about +1.9 points in terms of balanced accuracy.

This approach aims to study brain morphometry as a whole and not as a set of different components, focusing mainly on the shape and relative position of different anatomical structures which is fundamental in neuro-anatomical studies. We propose a generic algorithm to estimate templates of sets of curves (fiber bundles) and closed surfaces (sub-cortical structures) which have the same “form” (topology) of the shapes present in the population. This atlas construction method is based on a Bayesian framework which brings to two main improvements with respect to previous shape based methods. First, it allows to estimate from the data set a parameter specific to each object which was previously fixed by the user: the trade-off between data-term and regularity of deformations. In a multi-object analysis these parameters balance the contributions of the different objects and the need for an automatic estimation is even more crucial. Second, the covariance matrix of the deformation parameters is estimated during the atlas construction in a way which is less sensitive to the outliers of the population.},

To this end, we propose an approximation scheme which gives as result a more concise but at the same time exhaustive representation of a fiber bundle. It is based on a novel computational model for fibers, called weighted currents, characterised by a metric that considers both the pathway and the anatomical locations of the endpoints of the fibers. Similarity has therefore a twofold connotation: geometrical and related to the connectivity. The core idea is to use this metric for approximating a fiber bundle with a set of weighted prototypes, chosen among the fibers, which represent ensembles of similar fibers. The weights are related to the number of fibers represented by the prototypes. The algorithm is divided into two steps. First, the main modes of the fiber bundle are detected using a modularity based clustering algorithm. Second, a prototype fiber selection process is carried on in each cluster separately. This permits to explain the main patterns of the fiber bundle in a fast and accurate way.},

The resulting white matter, together with the gray matter, are then deformed by the second diffeomorphism. The two diffeomorphisms are related and jointly optimised. In this way, the first diffeomorphisms explain the variability in structural connectivity within the population, namely both changes in the connected areas of the gray matter and in the geometry of the pathway of the tracts. The second diffeomorphisms put into correspondence the homologous anatomical structures across subjects. Fiber bundles are approximated with weighted prototypes using the metric of weighted currents. The atlas, the covariance matrix of deformation parameters and the noise variance of each structure are automatically estimated using a Bayesian approach. This method is applied to patients with Tourette syndrome and controls showing a variability in the structural connectivity of the left cortico-putamen circuit.},

	abstract = {Fiber bundles stemming from tractography algorithms contain many streamlines. They require therefore a great amount of computer memory and computational resources to be stored, visualised and processed. We propose an approximation scheme for fiber bundles which results in a parsimonious representation of weighted prototypes. Prototypes are chosen among the streamlines and they represent groups of similar streamlines. Their weight is related to the number of approximated streamlines. Both streamlines and prototypes are modelled as weighted currents. This computational model does not need point-to-point correspondences and two streamlines are considered similar if their endpoints are close to each other and if their pathways follow similar trajectories. Moreover, the space of weighted currents is a vector space with a closed-form metric. This permits easy computation of the approximation error and the selection of the prototypes is based on the minimisation of this error. We propose an iterative algorithm which approximates independently and simultaneously all the fascicles of the bundle in a fast and accurate way. We show that the resulting representation preserves the shape of the bundle and it can be used to accurately reconstruct the original structural connectivity. We evaluate our algorithm on bundles obtained from both deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms. The resulting approximations use on average only 2\% of the original streamlines as prototypes. This drastically reduces the computational burden of the processes where the geometry of the streamlines is considered. We demonstrate its effectiveness using as example the registration between two fiber bundles.},

	abstract = {We present a Bayesian framework for atlas construction of multi-object shape complexes comprised of both surface and curve meshes. It is general and can be applied to any parametric deformation framework and to all shape models with which it is possible to define probability density functions (PDF). Here, both curve and surface meshes are modelled as Gaussian random varifolds, using a finite-dimensional approximation space on which PDFs can be defined. Using this framework, we can automatically estimate the parameters balancing data-terms and deformation regularity, which previously required user tuning. Moreover, it is also possible to estimate a well-conditioned covariance matrix of the deformation parameters. We also extend the proposed framework to data-sets with multiple group labels. Groups share the same template and their deformation parameters are modelled with different distributions. We can statistically compare the groups’distributions since they are defined on the same space. We test our algorithm on 20 Gilles de la Tourette patients and 20 control subjects, using three sub-cortical regions and their incident white matter fiber bundles. We compare their morphological characteristics and variations using a single diffeomorphism in the ambient space. The proposed method will be integrated with the Deformetrica software package, publicly available at www.deformetrica.org.},

To this end, many specialized distance measures, such as MCP, have been used for fiber similarity. However, these distance based approaches require point-wise correspondence and focus only on the geometry of the fibers. Recent publications have highlighted that using microstructure measures along fibers improves tractography analysis. Also, many neurodegenerative diseases impacting white matter require the study of microstructure measures as well as the white matter geometry. Motivated by these, we propose to use a novel computational model for fibers, called functional varifolds, characterized by a metric that considers both the geometry and microstructure measure (e.g. GFA) along the fiber pathway. We use it to cluster fibers with a dictionary learning and sparse coding-based framework, and present a preliminary analysis using HCP data.},

Grey and white matter components may be modeled as 3-D surfaces and curves, respectively. Neurodevelopmental disorders involve morphological and organizational alterations which cannot be jointly captured by usual shape analysis techniques based on single diffeomorphisms. We propose a new deformation scheme, called double diffeomorphism, which is a combination of two diffeomorphisms. The first one captures changes in structural connectivity, whereas the second one recovers the global morphological variations of both grey and white matter structures. This deformation model is integrated into a Bayesian framework for atlas construction. We evaluate it on a data-set of 3-D structures representing the neural circuits of patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). We show that this approach makes it possible to localise, quantify, and easily visualise the pathological anomalies altering the morphology and organization of the neural circuits. Furthermore, results also indicate that the proposed deformation model better discriminates between controls and GTS patients than a single diffeomorphism.},

	abstract = {Tractograms are mathematical representations of the main paths of axons within the white matter of the brain, from diffusion MRI data. Such representations are in the form of polylines, called streamlines, and one streamline approximates the common path of tens of thousands of axons. The analysis of tractograms is a task of interest in multiple fields, like neurosurgery and neurology. A basic building block of many pipelines of analysis is the definition of a distance function between streamlines. Multiple distance functions have been proposed in the literature, and different authors use different distances, usually without a specific reason other than invoking the “common practice”. To this end, in this work we want to test such common practices, in order to obtain factual reasons for choosing one distance over another. For these reason, in this work we compare many streamline distance functions available in the literature. We focus on the common task of automatic bundle segmentation and we adopt the recent approach of supervised segmentation from expert-based examples. Using the HCP dataset, we compare several distances obtaining guidelines on the choice of which distance function one should use for supervised bundle segmentation.},

Their function is, in many cases, still an object of study and might be affected in some syndromes or conditions. Obtaining a reproducible and correct segmentation is therefore crucial both in clinics and in research. However, it is difficult to obtain due to the huge number of fibers and high inter-subject variability. In this paper, we propose to segment and recognize tracts by directly modeling their anatomical definitions, which are usually based on relationships between structures. Since these definitions are mainly qualitative, we propose to model their intrinsic vagueness using fuzzy spatial relations and combine them into a single quantitative score mapped to each fiber. To cope with the high redundancy of tractograms and ease interpretation, we also take advantage of a simplification scheme based on a multi-resolution representation. This allows for an interactive and real-time navigation through different levels of detail.

	abstract = {Objective
To show the interest of tractography in pelvic surgery by a demonstrative case of neurofibroma resected by robotic assisted laparoscopy.
Summary background data
Although diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, along with tractography algorithms, is increasingly included in image guided neurosurgery methods, it is less frequently used for the peripheral nervous system such as the pelvic sacral plexus. We report one observation demonstrating the interest of such image data for pelvic surgery.
Methods
A 12-years-old girl with neurofibromatosis presented with a growing left pelvic neurofibroma on repeated pelvic MRI with an increased SUV (2.83) on PET scan. A diffusion tensor pelvic MRI was performed before and after robotically assisted tumoral resection, and a tractography algorithm was applied on both images.
Results
The pre-operative tractogram showed the nervous nature of the tumor in close contact with the left sacral plexus. Section of a nerve trunk encased in the neurofibroma was mandatory for the resection and well documented by the 3D enhanced vision provided by the robot. Post-operatively, the patient showed a slight paresthesia and dysesthesia of the left leg calf and of the plantar vault (left S2 territory), without any motor deficit. The post-operative tractogram showed a thinning of the left S2 sacral root and the disappearance of right aberrant nervous tracts.
Conclusions
This clinical case validates the ability of pelvic tractography to deliver a proper imaging of the sacral nervous network and emphasizes the potential usefulness of this approach in pelvic surgery management, with perspectives of image-guided surgery.},

In all these models shapes are seen as elements of a space of generalized distributions, such as currents or varifolds. Then norms are defined through reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), which lead to shape distances that can be conveniently computed in practice. These were originally introduced in conjunction with diffeomorphic methods in computational anatomy and have indeed proved to be very efficient in this field. We provide a basic description of these different models and their practical implementation, then discuss the respective properties and potential advantages or downsides of each of them in diffeomorphic registration problems.},

	abstract = {The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation has been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from different modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy, with respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However, acquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due to a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan time. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we propose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal network (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an adaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network is trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher’s inputs (n modalities). We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor segmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we show that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always outperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.},

	abstract = {Diffusion MRI ﬁber tracking datasets can contain millions of 3D streamlines, and their representation can weight tens of gigabytes of memory. These sets of streamlines are called tractograms and are often used for clinical operations or research. Their size makes them difﬁcult to store, visualize, process or exchange over the network. We propose a new compression algorithm well-suited for tractograms, by taking advantage of the way streamlines are obtained with usual tracking algorithms. Our approach is based on unit vector quantization methods combined with a spatial transformation which results in low compression and decompression times, as well as a high compression ratio. For instance, a 11.5GB tractogram can be compressed to a 1.02GB ﬁle and decompressed in 11.3 seconds. Moreover, our method allows for the compression and decompression of individual streamlines, reducing the need for a costly outof-core algorithm with heavy datasets. Last, we open a way toward on-the-ﬂy compression and decompression for handling larger datasets without needing a load of RAM (i.e. in-core handling), faster network exchanges and faster loading times for visualization or processing.},

Pediatric and adolescent patients with rare tumors and malformations should highly benefit from these latest technological innovations, allowing personalized tailored surgery. This study focused on the pelvic region, located at the crossroads of the urinary, digestive, and genital channels with important vascular and nervous structures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of different software tools to obtain patient-specific 3D models, through segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI), the reference for pediatric pelvis examination. Twelve software tools freely available on the Internet and two commercial software tools were evaluated using T2-w MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI images. The software tools were rated according to eight criteria, evaluated by three different users: automatization degree, segmentation time, usability, 3D visualization, presence of image registration tools, tractography tools, supported OS, and potential extension (i.e., plugins). A ranking of software tools for 3D modeling of MRI medical images, according to the set of predefined criteria, was given. This ranking allowed us to elaborate guidelines for the choice of software tools for pelvic surgical planning in pediatric patients. The best-ranked software tools were Myrian Studio, ITK-SNAP, and 3D Slicer, the latter being especially appropriate if nerve fibers should be included in the 3D patient model. To conclude, this study proposed a comprehensive review of software tools for 3D modeling of the pelvis according to a set of eight criteria and delivered specific conclusions for pediatric and adolescent patients that can be directly applied to clinical practice.},

The development of automated stereotactic planning tools has been described in the literature. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of stereotactic planning procedure automation and develop tools for patients undergoing neurosurgical stereotactic procedures. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to September 1, 2019, at the exception of Google Scholar (from 1 January 2010 to September 1, 2019) in French and English. Eligible studies included all studies proposing automated stereotactic planning. A total of 1543 studies were screened. Forty-two studies were included in the systematic review, including 18 (42.9\%) conference papers. The surgical procedures planned automatically were mainly deep brain stimulation (n = 14, 33.3\%), stereoelectroencephalography (n = 12, 28.6\%), and not specified (n = 10, 23.8\%). The most frequently used surgical constraints to plan the trajectory were blood vessels (n = 32, 76.2\%), cerebral sulci (n = 27, 64.3\%), and cerebral ventricles (n = 23, 54.8\%). The distance from blood vessels ranged from 1.96 to 4.78 mm for manual trajectories and from 2.47 to 7.0 mm for automated trajectories. At least one neurosurgeon was involved in 36 studies (85.7\%). The automated stereotactic trajectory was preferred in 75.4\% of the studied cases (range 30–92.9). Only 3 (7.1\%) studies were multicentric. No study reported prospective use of the planning software. Stereotactic planning automation is a promising tool to provide valuable stereotactic trajectories for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Due to a high heterogeneity in pose and size and to a limited number of available data, segmentation of pediatric images is challenging for deep learning methods. In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose and scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our architecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated together during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity matrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable module to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module, based on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the original UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and scale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module learns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size. Furthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows saving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test the proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal pediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization of size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard data-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney (88.01\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\% to 87.12\%).},

Clinica aims for researchers to (i) spend less time on data management and processing, (ii) perform reproducible evaluations of their methods, and (iii) easily share data and results within their institution and with external collaborators. The core of Clinica is a set of automatic pipelines for processing and analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data (currently, T1-weighted MRI, diffusion MRI, and PET data), as well as tools for statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. It relies on the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) for the organization of raw neuroimaging datasets and on established tools written by the community to build its pipelines. It also provides converters of public neuroimaging datasets to BIDS (currently ADNI, AIBL, OASIS, and NIFD). Processed data include image-valued scalar fields (e.g., tissue probability maps), meshes, surface-based scalar fields (e.g., cortical thickness maps), or scalar outputs (e.g., regional averages). These data follow the ClinicA Processed Structure (CAPS) format which shares the same philosophy as BIDS. Consistent organization of raw and processed neuroimaging files facilitates the execution of single pipelines and of sequences of pipelines, as well as the integration of processed data into statistics or machine learning frameworks. The target audience of Clinica is neuroscientists or clinicians conducting clinical neuroscience studies involving multimodal imaging, and researchers developing advanced machine learning algorithms applied to neuroimaging data.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality applications have rapidly spread across online retail platforms and social media, allowing consumers to virtually try-on a large variety of products, such as makeup, hair dying, or shoes. However, parametrizing a renderer to synthesize realistic images of a given product remains a challenging task that requires expert knowledge. While recent work has introduced neural rendering methods for virtual try-on from example images, current approaches are based on large generative models that cannot be used in real-time on mobile devices. This calls for a hybrid method that combines the advantages of computer graphics and neural rendering approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on deep learning to build a real-time inverse graphics encoder that learns to map a single example image into the parameter space of a given augmented reality rendering engine. Our method leverages self-supervised learning and does not require labeled training data, which makes it extendable to many virtual try-on applications. Furthermore, most augmented reality renderers are not differentiable in practice due to algorithmic choices or implementation constraints to reach real-time on portable devices. To relax the need for a graphics-based differentiable renderer in inverse graphics problems, we introduce a trainable imitator module. Our imitator is a generative network that learns to accurately reproduce the behavior of a given non-differentiable renderer. We propose a novel rendering sensitivity loss to train the imitator, which ensures that the network learns an accurate and continuous representation for each rendering parameter. Automatically learning a differentiable renderer, as proposed here, could be beneficial for various inverse graphics tasks. Our framework enables novel applications where consumers can virtually try-on a novel unknown product from an inspirational reference image on social media. It can also be used by computer graphics artists to automatically create realistic rendering from a reference product image.},

	abstract = {Abstract Hair appearance is a complex phenomenon due to hair geometry and how the light bounces on different hair fibers. For this reason, reproducing a specific hair color in a rendering environment is a challenging task that requires manual work and expert knowledge in computer graphics to tune the result visually. While current hair capture methods focus on hair shape estimation many applications could benefit from an automated method for capturing the appearance of a physical hair sample, from augmented/virtual reality to hair dying development. Building on recent advances in inverse graphics and material capture using deep neural networks, we introduce a novel method for hair color digitization. Our proposed pipeline allows capturing the color appearance of a physical hair sample and renders synthetic images of hair with a similar appearance, simulating different hair styles and/or lighting environments. Since rendering realistic hair images requires path-tracing rendering, the conventional inverse graphics approach based on differentiable rendering is untractable. Our method is based on the combination of a controlled imaging device, a path-tracing renderer, and an inverse graphics model based on self-supervised machine learning, which does not require to use differentiable rendering to be trained. We illustrate the performance of our hair digitization method on both real and synthetic images and show that our approach can accurately capture and render hair color.},

	title = {Anatomically constrained {CT} image translation for heterogeneous blood vessel segmentation},
	abstract = {Anatomical structures such as blood vessels in contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) images can be challenging to segment due to the variability in contrast medium diffusion. The combined use of ceCT and contrast-free (CT) CT images can improve the segmentation performances, but at the cost of a double radiation exposure. To limit the radiation dose, generative models could be used to synthesize one modality, instead of acquiring it. The CycleGAN approach has recently attracted particular attention because it alleviates the need for paired data that are difficult to obtain. Despite the great performances demonstrated in the literature, limitations still remain when dealing with 3D volumes generated slice by slice from unpaired datasets with different fields of view. We present an extension of CycleGAN to generate high fidelity images, with good structural consistency, in this context. We leverage anatomical constraints and automatic region of interest selection by adapting the Self-Supervised Body Regressor. These constraints enforce anatomical consistency and allow feeding anatomically-paired input images to the algorithm. Results show qualitative and quantitative improvements, compared to stateof-the-art methods, on the translation task between ceCT and CT images (and vice versa).},

	abstract = {In medical imaging, most of the image registration methods implicitly assume a one-to-one correspondence between the source and target images (i.e., diffeomorphism). However, this is not necessarily the case when dealing with pathological medical images (e.g., presence of a tumor, lesion, etc.). To cope with this issue, the Metamorphosis model has been proposed. It modifies both the shape and the appearance of an image to deal with the geometrical and topological differences. However, the high computational time and load have hampered its applications so far. Here, we propose a deep residual learning implementation of Metamorphosis that drastically reduces the computational time at inference. Furthermore, we also show that the proposed framework can easily integrate prior knowledge of the localization of topological changes (e.g., segmentation masks) that can act as spatial regularization to correctly disentangle appearance and shape changes. We test our method on the BraTS 2021 dataset, showing that it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the alignment of images with brain tumors.},

To estimate accurate and generalizable models, large datasets have been collected, which are often multi-site and multi-scanner. This large heterogeneity negatively affects the generalization performance of DL models since they are prone to overfit site-related noise. Recently, contrastive learning approaches have been shown to be more robust against noise in data or labels. For this reason, we propose a novel contrastive learning regression loss for robust brain age prediction using MRI scans. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenBHB challenge, yielding the best generalization capability and robustness to site-related noise.},

Our method increases performances at low annotated data regime both in supervision accuracy and in convergence speed. In contrast to previous work, no generative model is needed for transformation optimization. Transformed images keep relevant information to solve the supervised task, here classification. Experiments were performed on 34000 2D slices of brain Magnetic Resonance Images and 11200 chest X-ray images. On both datasets, with 10\% of labeled data, our model achieves better performances than a fully supervised model with 100\% labels.},

Some organs are more challenging to delineate than others, for instance due to low contrast at their boundaries. In this paper, we propose to improve the segmentation of elongated organs thanks to Geometrical Priors that can be introduced during training, using a local Tversky loss function, or at post-processing, using local thresholds. Both strategies do not introduce additional training parameters and can be easily applied to any existing network. The proposed method is evaluated on the challenging problem of pancreas segmentation. Results show that Geometrical Priors allow us to correct the systematic under-segmentation pattern of a state-of-the-art method, while preserving the overall segmentation quality.},

However, the gold standard diagnosis of the cirrhosis needs a medical intervention to obtain the histological confirmation, e.g. the METAVIR score, as the radiological presentation can be equivocal. In this work, we propose to leverage transfer learning from large datasets annotated by radiologists, which we consider as a weak annotation, to predict the histological score available on a small annex dataset. To this end, we propose to compare different pretraining methods, namely weakly-supervised and self-supervised ones, to improve the prediction of the cirrhosis. Finally, we introduce a loss function combining both supervised and self-supervised frameworks for pretraining. This method outperforms the baseline classification of the METAVIR score, reaching an AUC of 0.84 and a balanced accuracy of 0.75, compared to 0.77 and 0.72 for a baseline classifier.},

In addition to its technical benefits, robotic surgery allows integration of technological enhancements, such as artificial-intelligence-based software or tri-dimensional (3D) modeling, into the operating room. In this article, we report our experience in robotic-assisted surgery for the resection of pediatric tumors and present current developments in 3D modeling applied to pelvic tumors. Since 2016, 149 oncology cases have been undertaken using the robotic approach. Neuroblastic tumors account for the most part, with a median hospital stay of two days [1–7 days] and very few intraoperative events. The use of robotics was mainly extended to renal tumors (predominantly Wilms tumors) and endocrine tumors, but was found of particular interest for pelvic tumors. Our experience led us to publish a first set of guidelines on robotic surgical oncology, focusing on its apparent contraindications. 3D models derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging have been developed for more than 150 patients with solid tumors, but the pelvic area was made a key focus because of its anatomical complexity. In addition to their educational benefits, some of these 3D models were integrated into the robotic console as a surgical aid and proved invaluable for difficult dissections or nerve plexus preservation. As evidenced by the development of robotics and 3D modeling, pediatric oncology is leaning toward ultra-precise surgical resection tailored to the patient and the tumor.},

For this reason, learning unbiased models from biased data has become a very relevant research topic in the last years. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning representations that are robust to biases. We first present a margin-based theoretical framework that allows us to clarify why recent contrastive losses (InfoNCE, SupCon, etc.) can fail when dealing with biased data. Based on that, we derive a novel formulation of the supervised contrastive loss (\${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-SupInfoNCE), providing more accurate control of the minimal distance between positive and negative samples. Furthermore, thanks to our theoretical framework, we also propose FairKL, a new debiasing regularization loss, that works well even with extremely biased data. We validate the proposed losses on standard vision datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, and we assess the debiasing capability of FairKL with \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-SupInfoNCE, reaching state-of-the-art performance on a number of biased datasets, including real instances of biases "in the wild".},
